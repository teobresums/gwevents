Welcome! Here you find gravitational waveforms (GWs) corresponding the
"best" parameters of the LIGO-Virgo sources and computed the
state-of-art effective-one-body model [`TEOBResumS`]({{site.url}}/about/).

`TEOBResumS` solves the general relativistic two-body problem and
generates dynamics and waveforms of colliding black holes and neutron
star binaries. It can be used to analyze the GW data
and to extract the source parameters as well as to predict new waveforms.
It describes motion and radiation of the coalescence process, from the
low-frequency quasi-circular inspiral regime all the way to merger
(and ringdown, for black hole binaries).
